Dockerfile consists of:

1) FROM: specifies the base image
2) WORKDIR: specifies which directory you want to start from (in the container);
	    In /home/ubuntu we copy the contents of script folder	
3) COPY: COPY <source folder> <destination folder>; here '.' means everywhere
4) RUN: another way to run a command
5) WORKDIR: this redirects us /github_folder/UNext after we run the shellscript file
6) CMD: another way to run a command
7) EXPOSE: specifies what ports we can connect to

test.sh consists of:

1)Normal shell commands that we run in terminal are listed in the shellscript
2)n 20: this specifies that we need to install version 20 of n
3)$SHELL: this helps in changing directories
